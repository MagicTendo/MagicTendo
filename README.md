## 👋🫠 Hiiiii~~ !

- MagicTendo was my previous username, and I don't want to create a new account to update it
- I'm not very active on Github and I'm very bad using it
- I know how to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Node.js included), and a bit of Python, Java, C, C# and Lua !
- I'm VERY disorganised (send help)


## 🍙 Main projects

- My main one is [Yunayunori](https://yunranohi.rf.gd), a fictionnal universe I'm creating and which website only has (not very good) games for now (currently in rework) !
- I also have a Discord bot, [Tokinotsuki](https://tokinotsuki.rf.gd) which got an update recently !
- And I have a personnal website named [BakaTaida.rf.gd](https://bakataida.rf.gd/) showing off my projects !


## 🍡 Side projects

- I have another website but for YTPMVs, called [YTPMV.rf.gd](https://ytpmv.rf.gd) in which you can download source packs of popular sources (needs an update).
- And I have a last website, the [Baka Wiki](https://baka-wiki.rf.gd), which is a French encyclopedia of the lore of Yunayunori (deprecated and also needs an update) !
- I also made some APIs and there are available in my [Github Pages](https://magictendo.github.io/api/) !
